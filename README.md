# Draft Kicker: 4th and Inches

A fun browser-based field-goal kicking game!

## Play the Game
1. Enter your **team name** to start.
2. Swipe or drag up to kick the ball. The stronger the swipe, the more powerful the kick.
3. Account for wind direction/speed to make that field goal!
4. Watch your score and check the leaderboard.

## Development
- **`style.css`** — game styles
- **`main.js`** — core game logic + DOM interaction
- **`sw.js`** — service worker for offline caching
- **`manifest.json`** — PWA install support

### Run locally
Just open in your browser. For full PWA support, serve via HTTPS or `localhost`.
